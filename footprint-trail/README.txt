This Godot plug-in allows you to print footprints behing a CharacterBody3D. Add the 
"footprints_trail" directory to your project by copying it in "res://addons".

1. Add a FootprintsTrail node as a child of a CharacterBody3d node.
2. Position it at the feet of your character.
2. Assign a material for the footprints (a simple texture works).
3. Define the distance between two footprints and the delay before footprints desapear.
